// while loop and for loop is same to same but different is we know start and ending point for loop but 
// while loop we know start but but don't know ending point for example you create a terminal base website user when failed again he can try to logged but you don't know when he successfully logged in 


// while(true){
// console.log("hwllo world")
// }


// ** variable call out of loop


// let i =1;
// while(i<100){
//     console.log(i)
//      i++
// }

let sum = 0
let i =1
while(i<=5){
sum +=i;
i++
}
console.log(sum)
