## History of JavaScript
 1995 – Birth of JavaScript

JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich while he was working at Netscape.

The first version was developed in just 10 days.

Initially, it was named Mocha, then LiveScript, and finally JavaScript.

Despite the name, JavaScript is not related to Java. The name was mainly used for marketing purposes.

### Why JavaScript Was Created

In the early days, websites were:

Static (no interaction)

Only displayed text and images

JavaScript was introduced to:

Add interactivity to web pages

Validate forms in the browser

Respond to user actions like clicks and input

### 1997 – Standardization (ECMAScript)

JavaScript was standardized under the name ECMAScript.

This ensured JavaScript would behave consistently across different browsers.

### 2000s – Growth Era

JavaScript became essential for web development.

Libraries like jQuery simplified complex tasks.

Websites became more dynamic and user-friendly.

### 2009 – Server-Side JavaScript

Node.js was introduced, allowing JavaScript to run outside the browser.

This made JavaScript a full-stack language.

### 2015 – ES6 Revolution

ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) introduced major features like:

let and const

Arrow functions

Classes

Modules

This modernized JavaScript significantly.

###  Present Day

JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages in the world.

Used in:

Frontend (React, Vue, Angular)

Backend (Node.js)

Mobile apps

Desktop apps

Game development
